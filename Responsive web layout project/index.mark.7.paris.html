England at the head of a 50-mile estuary leading to the North Sea,
London boasts a rich history spanning nearly 2,000 years. Its ancient core, 
the City of London, originally established by the Romans as Londinium, retains
its medieval boundaries and remains a pivotal financial center. Adjacent to 
it lies the City of Westminster, home to the national government and parliament
for centuries. From its rapid expansion in the 19th century to its modern-day
status, London has evolved from the world’s largest city during the Victorian 
era to the administrative region of Greater London, governed by 33 local
authorities and the Greater London Authority since 1965.
